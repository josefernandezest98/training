# Training Repository

This repository has been created for saving training scripts, that do not belong to any project. Every script should be well explained, and they are all independent.

- **Depth_Images:** calculating depth from stereo images, or at least disparity map. SIFT method from OpenCV. This is a personal researching line I would live to abroad in the future. The goal consists of getting a complete depth map from stereo images, using the data collected by the accelerometer and the gyroscope.
- **Fruit_Thresholding:** fruit thresholding in order to create synthetic datasets for training in computer vision detection.
- **Gradient_Descent_Gompertz:** gradient descent algorithm with TensorFlow trying to optimize the prediction of functions that follow Gompertz curve growth model.
- **PySpark_Training:** this directory contains the notebook consists of a kind of course with the basic functionalities of Apache PySpark with a FIFA 2017 dataset.
- **SAM:** testing the new transformer Segment Anything from Meta-AI (Facebook). Test with the picture of the Castle of Bamburgh in Northumberland.
